# MAKING A ROGUELIKE IN PROLOG

I want to make a very basic roguelike in prolog. Becuase the programming paradigm is
so unfamiliar to me I have made a roadmap below.

## STAGE 1 [2/4]
1. [X] Print a room with walls represented as # and floors represented as .
2. [X] Generate a random room
3. [X] Generate several random rooms that fit onto the screen
4. [ ] The rooms are connected by floor tiles

## STAGE 2
1. Print the @ symbol to represent the player
2. @ can be moved with keyboard input
3. @ cannot move into walls

## STAGE 3
1. A single room has a downstairs tile represented by the > character
2. Pressing the > key generates a new map of random rooms
3. Pressing the > key only generals a new map if the player is on the downstairs tile

## STAGE 4
1. Only tiles in a radius of 7 from the player are printed
2. Walls block the player's line of sight

## OTHER STAGES TBD
